# Analysis of Darts strategies

Author: _Erik Rodner_, 2016

In the following, we analyze for which position on a dart board a player should aim at. The position depends on the
aiming error of the player and we plot maps showing the expected score for different player skill levels.

The script was partly created during a lecture.

## Usage

Install python, python-matplotlib, python-tk and python-scipy

Run ``python darts_simulation.py``

## Results

The following figure shows the expected score you will get if you aim for a specific
position. The white circle marks the position with the maximum expected score.
